# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Classification
This project builds a classification model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various health metrics. The project uses Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.


# üìñ About the Project
The Heart Disease Classification project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on key health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The model uses common machine learning techniques and evaluation metrics for classification.


# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Pandas (Data Analysis)
- NumPy (Numerical Computation)
- Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
